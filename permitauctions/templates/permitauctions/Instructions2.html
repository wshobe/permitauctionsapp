<h3>Obtaining permits</h3>

<ul>
	<li>In each period, you may buy permits at auction, and the prices paid for these permits will be added to your costs. All producers will be obtaining their permits through the auction. In this session, there are {{session.config.num_demo_participants}} producers.</li>

	<li>There is a limited supply of permits for sale at auction. The number of permits for sale will start at {{session.config.initial_cap}} in the first period and will fall by {{session.config.cap_decrement}} each subsequent period.</li>

	<li>In each period's auction, you will be able to make a number of bids for permits, and for each permit bid, you will specify a price that is the maximum that you are willing to pay in the auction for that permit. You may bid different values for each bid that you make. As the supply of permits falls over time, fewer will be available to buy at auction. <!-- Your bids are only limited by your cash reserves. --></li>

	<li>The bids will be sorted from high to low, and orders will be filled in that order until the available supply is exhausted. All permits will be sold in the auction at a single uniform price. The price is set to the value of the first bid that is <i>not</i> filled. So, for example, if there are 4 permits for sale, and the bids are $10,$9,$8,$8,and $6, the first four bids will be successful and the last bid will be rejected. The price the winning bidders pay will be $6, the value of the first rejected bid. Note that the winning bids will generally be higher than (or possibly equal to) the price actually paid for the permits. Ties will be resolved by a random device.</li>

	<li> The auction will have a reserve price of {{ Constants.reserve_price }}. No bids below this amount will be allowed. Any permits not sold at the auction (if there are any) will simply be retired and will not be sold at a later time.</li>

	<li>Additional supply: If the auction clearing price would be above a targeted maximum price of {{session.config.price_containment_trigger}}, then additional permits will be offered for sale to reduce the likelihood that the auction price will rise above the targeted maximum. A stock of {{session.config.price_containment_reserve_amount}} permits is available for this purpose. This stock is replenished each period.</li>

{% if session.config.ecr_treatment == 'Step' %}	
<li>Supply reductions: Of the permits for sale at auction, up to {{session.config.initial_ecr_reserve_amount}} permits are in a compliance reserve and may be retired to keep the permit market from becoming oversupplied. If the auction price would fall below ${{session.config.ecr_trigger_price}}, permits in the reserve will be removed from the available supply in the auction so that the price will not fall below ${{session.config.ecr_trigger_price}}. The number of permits that can be removed is limited by the size of the reserve. Once the reserve is exhausted, the auction price would be allowed to fall below ${{session.config.ecr_trigger_price}}. For example, given the bids of 10,9,8,8 and 6 and a trigger price of $9, if there are 4 permits for sale, but with a trigger price of $9, one permit would be retired from the reserve and only three would be sold. In this case, the auction price would rise from $6 to $8, because the first rejected bid is now $8. The compliance reserve is the same in all periods.</li>
{% elif  session.config.ecr_treatment == 'Linear' %}
	<li>Supply reductions: Of the permits for sale at auction, up to {{session.config.initial_ecr_reserve_amount}} permits may be retired to keep the permit market from becoming oversupplied. If the auction price would fall below {{session.config.ecr_trigger_price}}, then for each $0.50 the price would fall below the trigger price, up to 2 permits will be removed from sale before the auction price is set. The final auction closing price will be calculated after the reserve permits have been removed from those available for sale. For example, with a low trigger price of $8, then to keep the auction price from closing at $7.50, up to 2 permits may be retired. To keep the price from closing at $7, up to 4 may be retired, etc. The reserve of {{session.config.initial_ecr_reserve_amount}} permits will be exhausted once the price reaches the reserve price. So, given the bids of $10,$9,$8,$8 and $6 and a trigger price of $8, if there are 4 permits for sale, two permits <i>could</i> be retired, but in this case, only one needs to be retired to prevent the price from falling below $8. With the retirement of one permit, the auction price would rise from $6 to $8, because the first rejected bid would now be $8.</li>
